R library for stubbing and setting expectations on HTTP requests.

Port of the Ruby gem [webmock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock)

<details> <summary><strong>How it works in detail</strong></summary> <p>

The very very short version is: `webmockr` helps you stub HTTP requests so you 
don't have to repeat yourself.

**More details**

You tell `webmockr` what HTTP request you want to match against and if it sees a 
request matching your criteria it doesn't actually do the HTTP request. Instead,
it gives back the same object you would have gotten back with a real request, but 
only with the bits it knows about. For example, we can't give back the actual 
data you'd get from a real HTTP request as the request wasn't performed.

In addition, if you set an expectation of what `webmockr` should return, we 
return that. For example, if you expect a request to return a 418 error 
(I'm a Teapot), then that's what you'll get.

**What you can match against**

* HTTP method (required)

Plus any single or combination of the following:

* URI
    * Right now, we can match directly against URI's, and with regex URI patterns. 
  Eventually, we will support RFC 6570 URI templates. 
    * We normalize URI paths so that URL encoded things match 
  URL un-encoded things (e.g. `hello world` to `hello%20world`)
* Query parameters
    * We normalize query parameter values so that URL encoded things match 
  URL un-encoded things (e.g. `message = hello world` to 
  `message = hello%20world`)
* Request headers
    * We normalize headers and treat all forms of same headers as equal. For 
  example, the following two sets of headers are equal:
        * `list(H1 = "value1", content_length = 123, X_CuStOm_hEAder = "foo")`
        * `list(h1 = "value1", "Content-Length" = 123, "x-cuSTOM-HeAder" = "foo")`
* Request body

**Real HTTP requests**

There's a few scenarios to think about when using `webmockr`:

After doing

```r
library(webmockr)
```

`webmockr` is loaded but not turned on. At this point `webmockr` doesn't 
change anythning.

Once you turn on `webmockr` like 

```r
webmockr::enable()
```

`webmockr` will now by default not allow real HTTP requests from the http 
libraries that adapters are loaded for (right now only `crul`).

You can optionally allow real requests via `webmockr_allow_net_connect()`, and
disallow real requests via `webmockr_disable_net_connect()`. You can check 
whether you are allowing real requests with `webmockr_net_connect_allowed()`.

Certain kinds of real HTTP requests allowed: We don't suppoprt this yet, 
but you can allow localhost HTTP requests with the `allow_localhost` parameter
in the `webmockr_configure()` function. 

**Storing actual HTTP responses**

`webmockr` doesn't do that. Check out [vcr][]

## Features

* Stubbing HTTP requests at low http client lib level
* Setting and verifying expectations on HTTP requests
* Matching requests based on method, URI, headers and body
* Support for `testthat` via [vcr][]
* Can be used for testing or outside of a testing context

## Supported HTTP libraries

* [crul](https://github.com/ropensci/crul)
* [httr](https://github.com/r-lib/httr)

> in development: curl

## Install

from cran

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("webmockr")
```

Dev version

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropensci/webmockr")
```

```{r}
library(webmockr)
```

## Enable webmockr

```{r}
webmockr::enable()
```

## Inside a test framework

```{r}
library(crul)
library(testthat)

# make a stub
stub_request("get", "https://httpbin.org/get") %>%
   to_return(body = "success!", status = 200)

# check that it's in the stub registry
stub_registry()

# make the request
z <- crul::HttpClient$new(url = "https://httpbin.org")$get("get")

# run tests (nothing returned means it passed)
expect_is(z, "HttpResponse")
expect_equal(z$status_code, 200)
expect_equal(z$parse("UTF-8"), "success!")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
stub_registry_clear()
```


## Outside a test framework

```{r}
library(crul)
```

### Stubbed request based on uri only and with the default response

```{r}
stub_request("get", "https://httpbin.org/get")
```

```{r}
x <- HttpClient$new(url = "https://httpbin.org")
x$get('get')
```

set return objects

```{r}
stub_request("get", "https://httpbin.org/get") %>%
  wi_th(
    query = list(hello = "world")) %>%
    to_return(status = 418)
```

```{r}
x$get('get', query = list(hello = "world"))
```

### Stubbing requests based on method, uri and query params

```{r}
stub_request("get", "https://httpbin.org/get") %>%
  wi_th(query = list(hello = "world"), 
        headers = list('User-Agent' = 'libcurl/7.51.0 r-curl/2.6 crul/0.3.6', 
                       'Accept-Encoding' = "gzip, deflate"))
```

```{r}
stub_registry()
```

```{r}
x <- HttpClient$new(url = "https://httpbin.org")
x$get('get', query = list(hello = "world"))
```

### Stubbing requests and set expectation of a timeout

```{r}
stub_request("post", "https://httpbin.org/post") %>% to_timeout()
x <- HttpClient$new(url = "https://httpbin.org")
x$post('post')
```

### Stubbing requests and set HTTP error expectation

```{r}
library(fauxpas)
stub_request("get", "https://httpbin.org/get?a=b") %>% to_raise(HTTPBadRequest)
x <- HttpClient$new(url = "https://httpbin.org")
x$get('get', query = list(a = "b"))
```

## httr integration

```{r}
library(webmockr)
library(httr)

# turn on httr mocking
httr_mock()
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# no stub found
GET("https://httpbin.org/get")
#> Error: Real HTTP connections are disabled.
#> Unregistered request:
#>   GET https://httpbin.org/get   with headers {Accept: application/json, text/xml, application/xml, */*}
#> 
#> You can stub this request with the following snippet:
#> 
#>    stub_request('get', uri = 'https://httpbin.org/get') %>%
#>      wi_th(
#>        headers = list('Accept' = 'application/json, text/xml, application/xml, */*')
#>      )
#> ============================================================
```

make a stub

```{r}
stub_request('get', uri = 'https://httpbin.org/get') %>%
  wi_th(
    headers = list('Accept' = 'application/json, text/xml, application/xml, */*')
  ) %>%
  to_return(status = 418, body = "I'm a teapot!!!", headers = list(im_a = "teapot"))
```

now returns mocked response


```{r eval=FALSE} 
(res <- GET("https://httpbin.org/get"))
res$status_code
#> [1] 418
res$response_headers
#> $im_a
#> [1] "teapot"
```
